**One bot. All your moderation. No bloat.**

Moderation+ is a powerful, modern Discord moderation bot designed to replace multiple third-party bots with a single, configurable system - without sacrificing control, reliability, or transparency.

Built with server owners and moderators in mind.

---

## 🚀 Add Moderation+ to Your Server

👉 **[Add Moderation+ to Discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1459939265935839388&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=applications.commands+bot)**

> Requires **Administrator** permissions to enable all features correctly.

## 🧠 Why Moderation+?

Most servers end up running **5–10 different bots** just to cover basic moderation, logging, roles, stats, and automation.

Moderation+ exists to fix that.

- One bot instead of many
- One configuration system
- One set of logs
- One consistent experience for moderators

No unnecessary features. No hidden paywalls. No nonsense.
